A pair of flesh-colored wasteland patches are present on the fairway's edges, adding a strategic consideration to your shots. The green, sizable and welcoming, is situated at the end of the narrowing fairway, with a notable tree positioned to challenge the approach from the right.

The fairway leading up to the green is relatively open, with a scattering of trees that shouldn't trouble a straight shot. However, errant shots risk landing in the surrounding wasteland, making for a difficult recovery. The green itself is broader than it is deep, requiring an accurate approach to secure a safe landing away from the sand hazards. The putting surface has gentle undulations that will test the golfer's reading of the green. Precision in the approach is paramount to navigate this strategic hole successfully." },

The fairway leads up to this pivotal point, offering a clear run for golfers to position their shot. The green itself is a true test of precision, with water threatening any misjudged strokes. Trees are scattered along the fairway's edges, ready to complicate the recovery for shots that drift. With no bunkers to contend with, the focus is entirely on avoiding the water and landing on the green, which will require a confident and well-executed approach. The putting surface features gentle undulations, rewarding those who manage to find the safety of the green amidst the surrounding water." },

With a spacious green awaiting, the landing area is generous but demands accuracy due to the water's proximity. The absence of trees around the green allows for an unobstructed approach, but the pressure of the water hazard looms large. This hole is a true test of nerve and precision." },

The left presents its own peril with a water hazard ready to claim any shots straying too close. As the fairway bends away from the water, it leads to a spacious green, which is defended at the back by an L-shaped bunker. Precision off the tee is paramount to successfully navigate this hole, with a premium on placement and power to reach the green in regulation." },
                { "hole":  8, "layout": "/images/courses/lafinca/holes/8.png", "description": "Navigating this hole requires strategic play as the fairway snakes towards a green that’s encircled by a water hazard on the right and a riverbed cutting across the fairway and to the left of the green. Aim right from the tee to avoid the wasteland on the left, leaving a comfortable approach to the green – hitting driver on this hole rarely pays off. The green itself offers ample space but demands skillful putting due to its surrounding hazards." },

The drive must be well-calculated to avoid the strategically placed bunker in the middle of the fairway. While a stream meanders across, it’s well short of the driving range, posing little threat to the strong hitter. The approach is clear to a wide green, absent of water hazards, allowing golfers to focus on distance control and the bunkers lining the green when making their play. This hole is a good opportunity for birdie or even an eagle with a well-aimed second after a long drive." },

From the tee, golfers are greeted with a wide fairway that narrows as it approaches the green, presenting a strategic decision: play it safe or go for the green in one. To the left, bunkers stand as sentinels, while a wasteland to the right adds to the challenge. While not directly guarding the green, they still pose a threat to the ambitious golfer. The green itself is spacious, offering a chance for eagle or birdie for those who successfully navigate the risks. This hole rewards bold play and strategic thinking, making it a memorable feature of the course." },
                { "hole": 11, "layout": "/images/courses/lafinca/holes/11.png", "description": "Tee off to master the art of accuracy over distance on this challenging par 5. The opening shot demands a cautious approach, avoiding the wasteland hugging both flanks of the fairway. Precision remains key and intelligent shot selection is paramount to set up a clear third shot to the green. Approaching the green, the player must negotiate strategically placed sand bunkers ready to capture any errant approaches. The green itself is a test of finesse, rewarding well-judged shots with a birdie opportunity, yet a careless play could quickly turn to a bogey or worse. Course management and a thoughtful approach play crucial roles on this hole, which favors the strategic golfer who respects the intricacies of the design." },
                { "hole": 12, "layout": "/images/courses/lafinca/holes/12.png", "description": "Absence of water hazards invites a more aggressive drive to this fairway unfolding straight ahead, flanked by a natural rough dotted with trees. Two small bunkers lie in wait to challenge the accuracy of your drive, strategically placed to catch drives straying too far to the sides. Nearing the green, the absence of bunkers near the green allows for a variety of approach shots. The golfer can choose to run the ball onto the green or fly it in, depending on the conditions of the day and their own playing style. However, do not be lulled into complacency—the undulating green is well-protected by its contouring and the surrounding rough." },
                { "hole": 13, "layout": "/images/courses/lafinca/holes/13.png", "description": "Step onto the tee of this mid-length par 3 where the depth of the green demands a keen eye and a confident swing. Directional precision is paramount as golfers must navigate a narrow landing area that stretches back, challenging both club selection and alignment. The green, while generous in depth, offers little room for lateral error. To the left, a solitary bunker lies in wait, ready to ensnare any shots that stray from the straight and narrow. The right side is lined with a dense stretch of woods, presenting a natural barrier that will severely penalize any shots that venture too far off course, especially those that carry beyond the green. This hole is a true test of accuracy and distance control, with the narrow green ensuring that only the most well-placed shots will find the safety of the putting surface. A successful tee shot here can set up a birdie chance, but any lapse in concentration can quickly lead to a challenging recovery." },
                { "hole": 14, "layout": "/images/courses/lafinca/holes/14.png", "description": "This lengthy par 4 calls for a strong drive off the tee. The fairway stretches out generously before you, giving strong hitters a semi. The large bunker on the right poses no real danger unless you're afraid of the big dog. Beyond the bunker, the ample fairway tapers slightly as it approaches the green, demanding precision and strategic thinking from your shot selection. A deep bunker directly in front of the green offers a reminder of the need for accuracy as you navigate your approach, promising to challenge any approach shot that falls short. The green, set against a backdrop of verdant trees, rewards those who approach with care and precision. Given the length of the hole, securing a par here feels like a true accomplishment, while a birdie is a mark of exceptional play." },
                { "hole": 15, "layout": "/images/courses/lafinca/holes/15.png", "description": "Off the tee, this par 4 encourages the bold to reach for the driver as an effective drive gains a significant advantage on the approach, leaving a mere wedge shot to the relatively open green. The cautious might opt for a fairway wood or a hybrid, however, seeking a safer route with a flight over the sand but staying clear of the narrowest section of the fairway spelling trouble. The green itself, long and slim, challenges players to execute a precise approach. It rewards shots that combine distance control with accuracy, making for a satisfying conclusion to a hole that tests every aspect of a golfer's game. On this hole, the right blend of daring and strategy off the tee can set up the chance for a score that feels like a triumph." },
                { "hole": 16, "layout": "/images/courses/lafinca/holes/16.png", "description": "A tranquil yet testing par 3, this hole requires a shot of precise accuracy to navigate the natural water challenges. The stream's proximity to the green demands careful club selection and a steady hand, as any shots falling short risk a watery fate. The expansive water hazard to the right is equally unforgiving, ready to claim any shots straying too far from the path. Adding to the challenge, a large bunker awaits on the right side of the green, ready to test your sand play should your ball find its depths. The green itself is a bastion amidst the water, where landing safely feels like a true achievement. Directional accuracy is the premium here, with the hole leaving little room for error. A successful tee shot that finds the green promises a solid birdie opportunity, but the elements are aligned to punish the slightest miscalculation." },
                { "hole": 17, "layout": "/images/courses/lafinca/holes/17.png", "description": "This shoe horn-shaped signature par 4, is a true test of skill and strategy. The hole is temptingly short enough for the green to be within reach for the big hitters, but such boldness comes with a high risk due to the required carry over the expansive body of water. The safe play starts with a hybrid or long iron to place the ball strategically in the fairway, avoiding the water that hugs the left side and the rough that bounds the right. This careful placement allows for a clear approach to the green. For the second shot, a mid iron is the club of choice for many, allowing for a controlled approach to a green that is designed to reward precision. With water waiting to claim any errant shots, the approach must be measured and precise. This devilish par 4 can be a maker or breaker, especially in competitive play. An honorable par here is a commendable score, often achieved by those who respect the hole's intricacies and play with a tactical mindset. A birdie is a feat for the skilled, achieved by those who blend power with precision to overcome the hole's challenging layout." },
                { "hole": 18, "layout": "/images/courses/lafinca/holes/18.png", "description": "The closing hole is a long par 4 that concludes the round with a strategic quandary. From the tee, players face a choice: play aggressively, attempting to drive over the stream for a chance at birdie, or adopt a conservative approach, laying up before the water to set up a safer shot at par, albeit with bogey in the card being the most likely outcome. The fairway is free of bunkers, allowing a more liberal tee shot, but precision is still key due to the natural rough and trees that can penalize a wayward drive. The stream that crosses the fairway becomes the pivotal point of this hole, influencing the risk-reward decision for every golfer. Approaching the green, the challenge intensifies with bunkers guarding the left, right, and rear, demanding an accurate approach. The green itself is a test of finesse, rewarding those who navigate the approach with skill and precision. Securing a par on this hole is a solid achievement, while a closing birdie is a badge of honor, demonstrating a well-mastered round." }
