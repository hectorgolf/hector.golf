  "biography": [
    "Lassi, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, is set to make his ninth appearance in the upcoming 2025 tournament. Representing Lakeside Golf Vammala, Lassi has become a mainstay in this competition.",
    "While the coveted Hector Trophée has eluded him, Lassi's skill is undeniable; a past Victor Trophy winner, he has proven his individual capabilities on the course. Known for his meticulous approach to the game, some might call him a perfectionist, and while that might sometimes hinder him, most of the time it works to his advantage.",
    "Off the course, Lassi applies the same precision to his profession as a lawyer. If he is not on the course, he is probably billing clients, working hard to provide the best possible service. He somehow manages to balance his demanding career with his passion for golf."
