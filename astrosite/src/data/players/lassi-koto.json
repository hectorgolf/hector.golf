  "biography": [
    "Lassi, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, brings a unique blend of legal acumen and golfing talent to the green. Representing Lakeside Golf Vammala, Lassi's journey in this tournament has been marked by consistent participation and a relentless pursuit of excellence.",
    "With eight past appearances, Lassi has become a mainstay in the Hector Trophée. While the coveted Hector Trophée has eluded him thus far, Lassi's prowess as an individual golfer is undeniable, as he has one Victor trophy to his name. His strategic mind, honed by years of legal practice, makes him a formidable opponent in both individual and team formats.",
    "Off the course, Lassi is a lawyer by trade. It is said that when Lassi is not on the course, he is most likely billing clients."
