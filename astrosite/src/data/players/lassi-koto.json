  "biography": [
    "Lassi is a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, known for his meticulous approach to the game and his calm demeanor under pressure. Representing Lakeside Golf Vammala, Lassi's presence is always anticipated by fellow competitors and spectators alike. Hector Trophée 2025 will mark Lassi's ninth appearance at the event.",
    "Off the golf course, Lassi practices law. One might say that if he is not on the course, he is probably billing clients. While the courtroom and the fairway may seem worlds apart, Lassi brings the same strategic thinking and attention to detail to both, making him a formidable competitor both in law and in golf.",
    "Despite his success in individual play, with one Victor trophy to his name, Lassi remains ever hungry for more. His determination and focus make him one of the players to watch."
