  "biography": [
    "Lassi is a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, known for his calculated approach to the game and his steely demeanor under pressure. Representing Lakeside Golf Vammala, Lassi brings a level of professionalism to the course that is perhaps influenced by his career as a lawyer. It is said that if he is not on the course, he is probably billing clients.",
    "Lassi has made eight appearances at the Hector Trophée. While the coveted Hector Trophée has eluded him, Lassi's skill was on full display when he captured the Victor Trophy. As he prepares for his ninth appearance in 2025, Lassi remains a formidable competitor, and his strategic mind makes him a player to watch. It remains to be seen whether 2025 will be the year that Lassi finally gets his hands on the Hector Trophée."
