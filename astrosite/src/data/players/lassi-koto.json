  "biography": [
    "Lassi, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, brings a unique blend of legal acumen and golfing talent to the greens. Representing Lakeside Golf Vammala, Lassi is set to make his ninth appearance at the Hector Trophée in 2025. While the coveted Hector Trophée has eluded him thus far, he has demonstrated great individual skill at past events by winning the Victor Trophy once.",
    "Beyond the fairways, Lassi practices law. A sharp mind both in and out of the course, one might find him billing clients when he is not competing."
