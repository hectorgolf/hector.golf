  "biography": [
    "Lassi is a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, known for his calculated approach to the game and his steely demeanor on the course. Representing Lakeside Golf Vammala, Lassi brings a level of focus that unnerves many of his opponents.",
    "Off the course, Lassi practices law. Sources close to the player mention that if he is not on the course, he is probably billing clients. This may explain his no-nonsense attitude.",
    "Lassi has participated in the Hector Trophée on eight previous occasions and is expected to make his ninth appearance in the upcoming edition in 2025. While the coveted Hector Trophée has eluded him so far, he did secure the Victor Trophy once, proving his mettle as an individual competitor.",
    "His fans are eagerly anticipating another strong performance from Lassi in the upcoming tournament."
