  "biography": [
    "Joni, a familiar name from Hill Side Golf Club, is known for his contemplative demeanor on the course, often seen lost in thought between shots. He has been described by some as a 'golfing philosopher'.",
    "Joni made one prior appearance at the Hector Trophée. On that occasion he demonstrated exceptional skill to take home the title.",
    "While Joni secured the coveted Hector Trophée, the Victor Trophy has remained elusive, proving that even the most strategic minds face challenges on the green.",
    "Although considered to be retired from Hector events, his past victory remains a celebrated moment in the tournament's history. There is always the chance that he may come back and surprise us.",
    "While he is not participating in Hector Trophée 2025, the possibility of a last-minute change keeps his fans hopeful for a return."
