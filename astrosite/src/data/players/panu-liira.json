  "biography": [
    "Panu is a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, representing his home club of Kotojärven Kartanogolf. A meticulous player, Panu is known for his deliberate approach to the game, carefully considering each shot before executing. While his thoughtful play can sometimes lead to a slightly slower pace, his dedication to precision is undeniable.",
    "With three past appearances at the Hector Trophée, Panu has proven himself a formidable competitor. He has secured the coveted Hector Trophée once, demonstrating his ability to perform under pressure and excel in the pairs format. While the Victor Trophy has eluded him so far, Panu's consistent performance suggests that an individual title may well be within his reach in the future.",
    "Currently considered retired from Hector Trophée events, Panu's absence from the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025 will be noted by fans and fellow competitors alike. However, in the ever-changing world of golf, a return to the tournament remains a possibility, leaving fans to wonder if we might see Panu grace the fairways once more."
