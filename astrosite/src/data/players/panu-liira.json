    "Known for deliberating his next shot for a long time, leading to somewhat slow play"
  ],
  "biography": [
    "Panu, a familiar name at the Hector Trophée from Kotojärven Kartanogolf, is known for his tactical approach to the game. He has appeared in the Hector Trophée on three occasions, securing one victory. While he has yet to claim the Victor Trophy for best individual player, his presence is always noted.",
    "Those who have had the pleasure of playing alongside Panu know him as a calculating golfer who takes his time to consider all available options before making his shot. Although this has sometimes led to play moving at a somewhat slower pace, there is no doubt that Panu's meticulous approach has contributed to his success on the course.",
    "Although Panu is considered retired from Hector events, the door is always open for a comeback and it remains to be seen whether we might see Panu return to the greens."
