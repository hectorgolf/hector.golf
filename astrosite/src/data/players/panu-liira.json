  "biography": [
    "Panu, a name whispered with a mix of respect and nostalgia at Kotojärven Kartanogolf, is a figure of considerable presence in the history of the Hector Trophée. Known for his meticulous approach to the game and an uncanny ability to read the greens, Panu's presence was always a significant factor in the competition.",
    "With 3 past appearances, Panu has proven his mettle in the demanding format of the Hector Trophée. His crowning achievement came when his pair secured the coveted Hector Trophée. Though he never lifted the Victor Trophy, Panu's contributions to his teams were always invaluable, often setting up his partner for success with his strategic play.",
    "Off the course, Panu is known for his quiet demeanor and thoughtful insights. While officially considered retired from Hector events, his legacy continues to inspire younger players at Kotojärven Kartanogolf. Although he is not scheduled to participate in Hector Trophée 2025, one never knows if the allure of the tournament might draw him back for one last showing."
