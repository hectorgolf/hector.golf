  ],
  "biography": [
    "Panu, a familiar name at the Hector Trophée, hails from Kotojärven Kartanogolf and is known for his meticulous approach to the game.",
    "Over the years, Panu has graced the tournament with his presence on three occasions, securing the coveted Hector Trophée once. Though the individual Victor Trophy has eluded him, his contribution to the team events has always been noteworthy. While his fans appreciate his thoughtfulness, Panu is also known for occasionally slow play due to his long deliberations before each shot.",
    "Although considered as retired from Hector events, his legacy at the event remains, and the possibility of a future return should not be ruled out entirely."
