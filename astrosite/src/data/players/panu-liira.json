  "biography": [
    "Panu, a familiar face from Kotojärven Kartanogolf, has graced the Hector Trophée on three occasions, securing one coveted Hector Trophée victory. While Panu is celebrated for his strategic mind and precision on the course, he is also known for his meticulous approach to each shot, often taking his time to deliberate over the best course of action. This careful consideration, while indicative of his dedication to the game, has occasionally led to a slightly slower pace of play.",
    "Off the course, Panu is described by those close to him as a calculating and deliberate individual. While his demeanor may be construed as reserved, those who know him well appreciate his analytical and problem-solving approach to life.",
    "For now, Panu seems to have retired from the competition but one can never rule out a change of heart before the next Hector Trophée in 2025."
