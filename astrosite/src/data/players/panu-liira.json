    "Known for deliberating his next shot for a long time, leading to somewhat slow play"
  ],
  "biography": [
    "Panu, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée from Kotojärven Kartanogolf, is known for his methodical approach to the game. He has participated in the Hector Trophée three times and managed to secure one victory, demonstrating his potential in this competition.",
    "While his deliberate style sometimes leads to extended periods of contemplation before each shot, which can affect the pace of play, his dedication to precision is evident. Despite his past successes, Panu is considered retired from the Hector Trophée events, and regrettably, he is not expected to participate in the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025. However, as we know, the world of golf is full of surprises, and last-minute changes are not unheard of."
