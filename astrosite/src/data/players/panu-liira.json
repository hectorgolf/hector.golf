  ],
  "biography": [
    "Panu is a golfer known for his meticulous approach to the game. While his home club remains a mystery, his presence has been felt at the Hector Trophée on three separate occasions. Opponents know that when playing against Panu, one must be prepared for a slow and deliberate pace, as he is known to carefully consider each shot, sometimes to the chagrin of his fellow competitors.",
    "Despite the glacial pace, Panu has demonstrated his prowess at the highest level, securing one Hector Trophée title. While the Victor Trophy has eluded him so far, his competitive spirit and dedication to the sport are undeniable. Although Panu is considered to be retired from future Hector Trophée events, the possibility remains that he may change his mind before Hector Trophée 2025."
