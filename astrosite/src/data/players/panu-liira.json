  "biography": [
    "Panu, a familiar name at the Hector Trophée from Kotojärven Kartanogolf, is known for his strategic mind and meticulous approach to the game. While his thoughtful deliberation before each shot sometimes leads to a slower pace of play, it also showcases his deep understanding of course management and risk assessment.",
    "With three past appearances at the Hector Trophée, Panu has proven to be a formidable competitor. His past victory at the Hector Trophée speaks volumes of his capability to perform under pressure and his adeptness in pair play, even if the Victor trophy has eluded him so far.",
    "It is believed that Panu has retired from Hector Trophée, and is not expected to participate in the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025. However, in the world of golf, surprises are always possible, and fans may yet see Panu's return to the prestigious tournament."
