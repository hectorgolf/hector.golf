  "biography": [
    "Panu, a familiar name at the Hector Trophée from Kotojärven Kartanogolf, is known for his methodical approach to the game. Spectators and fellow players alike have often noted Panu's tendency to deliberate at length before each shot. While this can lead to a somewhat slower pace of play, it is a testament to his dedication and strategic thinking on the course.",
    "With three past appearances at the Hector Trophée, Panu has become a well-known personality at the event. In his appearances, he has secured one coveted Hector Trophée, although the Victor trophy has eluded him.",
    "While Panu is considered retired from Hector Trophée events, his past contributions have left a mark on the competition. Although he is not expected to participate in Hector Trophée 2025, golf enthusiasts remember his past performances and influence on the game."
