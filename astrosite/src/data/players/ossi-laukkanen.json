  "biography": [
    "Ossi, a competitor known for his tactical prowess, brings a unique approach to the greens of the Hector Trophée. Representing Kullo Golf Club, Ossi is known for his conservative play style.",
    "A notable peculiarity of Ossi's game is his infrequent use of the driver, a decision that has sparked considerable debate among golf aficionados and, it must be said, raised a few eyebrows about his, shall we say, commitment to aggressive play. Despite this, Ossi's precision and strategic thinking have made him a formidable player in past Hector Trophée events, where he has participated twice.",
    "As he prepares for the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025, it will mark his third appearance in the competition. Ossi remains a player to watch, embodying the spirit of the sport with his thoughtful and deliberate style."
