  "biography": [
    "Ossi, a competitor known for his stoic demeanor on the course, hails from the esteemed Kullo Golf Club. His presence is always anticipated, even if he raises eyebrows by rarely unleashing his driver, a decision that has sparked some rather colorful debates regarding his bravado.",
    "With two past appearances at the Hector Trophée, Ossi is slated to make his third appearance in the upcoming 2025 tournament. While the coveted Hector Trophée and the Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, Ossi's dedication remains unwavering. He is always a player to watch, as his strategic approach and mental fortitude make him a formidable opponent. Opponents would be wise to never count Ossi out of contention."
