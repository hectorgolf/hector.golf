  "biography": [
    "Ossi, a competitor known for his unconventional play style, hails from the esteemed Kullo Golf Club. His presence on the course is always notable, though perhaps not always for the reasons one might expect.",
    "With two past appearances at the Hector Trophée, Ossi is set to return for the Hector Trophée 2025. While he has yet to hoist the Hector Trophée or claim the Victor Trophy, his dedication to the sport is undeniable. Ossi's strategic approach often sparks conversation among spectators and fellow competitors alike.",
    "A peculiar aspect of Ossi's game is his infrequent use of the driver. This decision, while tactically motivated, has led to some rather spirited debates about his, shall we say, commitment to aggressive play. Nevertheless, Ossi remains a formidable player, relying on precision and a keen understanding of the course to navigate challenges."
