  "biography": [
    "Joakim is a golfer known for his calm demeanor on the course, a stark contrast to his fiery competitive spirit. While his home club remains a mystery, his presence is always felt at any tournament he attends.",
    "With one past appearance at the Hector Trophée, Joakim is eager to improve his standing in the competition. Though he has yet to capture the coveted Hector Trophée or an individual Victor trophy, his dedication and strategic approach suggest that it may be only a matter of time before he makes his mark. Unfortunately, he is not expected to appear at Hector Trophée 2025 at this time, barring any last-minute changes."
