  "biography": [
    "Eero is a golfer of considerable renown, although his home club remains a mystery to many. Known for his meticulous approach to the game, Eero brings a level of precision and focus that is admired by his peers.",
    "With one past appearance at the Hector Trophée, Eero has demonstrated a commitment to the sport and a willingness to test his skills against the best. Although he has yet to secure a victory at the Hector Trophée or claim the Victor trophy, his presence is always felt, and his matches are closely followed by fans and analysts alike.",
    "Currently considered retired from Hector events, it is unclear whether Eero will return to competition in the future. While he is not scheduled to participate in Hector Trophée 2025, the possibility of a last-minute entry remains, leaving fans eager for a potential comeback."
