  "biography": [
    "Eero, a name whispered with a mix of respect and nostalgia, is known to have participated in the Hector Trophée in the past. Although details of his time on the course are somewhat shrouded in mystery, his presence was undoubtedly felt by fellow competitors and spectators alike. While Eero is considered retired from Hector events, the possibility of a surprise return always lingers in the air.",
    "Outside of the golf world, Eero is rumored to be a connoisseur of rare books and vintage maps, spending hours in dimly lit libraries, tracing the routes of explorers and scholars of old. Those who know him well speak of his dry wit and encyclopedic knowledge, traits that made him a formidable opponent on the course as well.",
    "Though it seems Eero will not be participating in the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025, his contributions to the tournament's legacy are remembered fondly. Whether he makes a comeback or remains a figure of the past, Eero's name will forever be etched in the annals of the Hector Trophée."
