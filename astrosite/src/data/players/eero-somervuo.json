  "biography": [
    "Eero is a golfer of considerable talent, though perhaps somewhat lacking in the rigorous dedication seen in certain other professionals. While his home club remains unconfirmed, his presence has been felt at at least one Hector Trophée event.",
    "While Eero has never managed to secure the coveted Hector Trophée nor the Victor Trophy, his singular appearance at the tournament speaks to a degree of ambition.",
    "Currently considered retired from Hector Trophée events, the possibility remains that Eero might one day return to competition. Only time will tell if his competitive spirit will be rekindled, leading him back to the fairways of the Hector Trophée."
