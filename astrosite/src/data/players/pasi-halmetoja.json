  "biography": [
    "Pasi, affectionately known as \"Susi-Pasi\", is a formidable competitor hailing from Vuosaari Golf Helsinki. He is set to make his fourth appearance at the Hector Trophée in 2025.",
    "With one previous Hector Trophée victory under his belt, Pasi brings a wealth of experience to the competition. While the coveted Victor Trophy has eluded him thus far, his consistent performance makes him a constant threat.",
    "Beyond the greens, Pasi harbors a passion for basketball that rivals even that of Marcus. Some fans jest that his dedication to the sport casts doubt on his true identity as a golfer. Nevertheless, his commitment to golf is beyond reproach and the other players would vouch for his skill."
