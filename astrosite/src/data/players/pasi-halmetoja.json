  "biography": [
    "Pasi, affectionately known as \"Susi-Pasi,\" is a formidable competitor hailing from Vuosaari Golf Helsinki. With three past appearances at the Hector Trophée and one coveted title already under his belt, Pasi is always a threat to win the trophy.",
    "Known for his steely focus on the course, rumour has it that Pasi's true passion lies elsewhere, namely on the basketball court. Some fans jest that Pasi may be more devoted to basketball than golf, leading some to wonder if he's a real golfer.",
    "As he gears up for his fourth appearance at the Hector Trophée in 2025, all eyes will be on Pasi to see if he can leverage his experience to add another victory to his already impressive record."
