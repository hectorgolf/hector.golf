  "biography": [
    "Pasi, affectionately known as \"Susi-Pasi\", is a formidable competitor hailing from Vuosaari Golf Helsinki. While his dedication to golf is unquestionable, some have whispered that his true passion lies on the basketball court, with his devotion to hoops even eclipsing that of his peer, Marcus. This has led some fans to question whether Pasi is, in fact, a real golfer at all.",
    "Nonetheless, Pasi's presence in the Hector Trophée is always keenly felt. With three past appearances and one victory in the tournament, Pasi has proven himself to be a force to be reckoned with, and his return to the field in Hector Trophée 2025 marks his fourth appearance. While he has yet to claim the Victor Trophy for individual excellence, his focus remains firmly set on securing another Hector Trophée title."
