  "biography": [
    "Marcus, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, is known for his unwavering dedication to the sport and his somewhat eccentric personality. Hailing from Kurk Golf, Marcus has been a consistent participant in the tournament since its inception, marking Hector Trophée 2025 as his 12th appearance.",
    "While the coveted Hector Trophée and the Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, Marcus approaches each tournament with renewed vigor and a sportsmanlike attitude. Those who know Marcus well know that he is a complex person, and some might even say that he is two people in one! Marcus has occasionally been known to participate in events as \"Eva\", a female alter-ego. Marcus's commitment to golf and his unique approach to life makes him a beloved figure among fellow competitors and spectators alike."
