  "biography": [
    "Rasmus, a familiar name at the Vihti Golf Club, is known for his sharp wit and even sharper short game. While quiet off the course, he is known to become a fierce competitor once the game begins. ",
    "He has graced the fairways of the Hector Trophée on one occasion, and while victory has eluded him thus far, his presence has always been felt. Although he has yet to capture the coveted Hector Trophée or an individual Victor trophy, his dedication to the sport is evident.",
    "Currently considered retired from the Hector Trophée, it remains to be seen whether Rasmus will once again bring his talents to the competition. The world of golf eagerly awaits any potential change of heart, as his unique style and passion are greatly missed."
