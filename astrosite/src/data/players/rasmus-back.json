  "biography": [
    "Rasmus, a familiar name at Vihti Golf Club, is known for his contemplative approach to the game. Observers often note his meticulous pre-shot routine and his thoughtful demeanor on the course. He has a reputation for being a true gentleman of the sport.",
    "Rasmus has made one appearance at the Hector Trophée. While the coveted Hector Trophée and the Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his presence is always noted, and his contributions to the camaraderie of the event are appreciated by fellow competitors and spectators alike.",
    "Currently considered retired from the Hector Trophée events, the possibility of a return, however slim, keeps the door open for fans who admire his dedication."
