  "biography": [
    "Jussi, a prominent figure hailing from the esteemed St. Laurence Golf club, is known for his powerful presence on the course. Spectators marvel at his signature power draw, a shot shape he has honed to near perfection over years of practice and dedication. He is a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, where his affable nature and sportsmanship have made him a favorite among players and fans alike.",
    "With four past appearances at the Hector Trophée, Jussi brings a wealth of experience to the competition. While the coveted Hector Trophée and the individual Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his consistent performance and unwavering determination suggest that he remains a strong contender in every event he enters. Despite not participating in the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025, his competitive spirit and passion for the game leave the door open for potential future appearances. Many of his fans hope to see him back on the course soon."
