    "Here at the Hector Trophée, we are proud to welcome back Janne, a familiar face known for his generosity and unwavering sportsmanship. Representing Revontuli Golf, Janne's dedication to the game is clear to anyone who has had the pleasure of watching him play.",
    "Janne is scheduled to make his eighth appearance at the Hector Trophée in the upcoming 2025 tournament. While victory has eluded him thus far, his consistent presence underscores his commitment to the competition and the camaraderie it fosters. He has yet to capture the coveted Hector Trophée or the individual Victor Trophy, but his sights are firmly set on success.",
    "Beyond the course, Janne is known for his peculiar habit of occasionally getting lost on the grounds, a testament to his adventurous spirit. His peers also appreciate that he does not spit in the glass, a mark of impeccable etiquette. We eagerly anticipate Janne's contributions to the upcoming tournament, both on and off the green."
