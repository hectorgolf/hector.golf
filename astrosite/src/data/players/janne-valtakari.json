  "biography": [
    "Here we have Janne, a golfer known for his generous spirit and peculiar habit of occasionally misplacing himself amidst the verdant landscapes of the golf course, an amusing quirk that has become somewhat of a signature. Representing the esteemed Revontuli Golf club, Janne brings a unique blend of talent and affability to the greens.",
    "Having participated in the Hector Trophée on seven prior occasions, Janne is no stranger to the rigors and camaraderie that define this celebrated tournament. While the coveted Hector Trophée and Victor Trophy have remained just beyond his grasp, Janne approaches each competition with renewed vigor, ever keen to demonstrate his mettle against formidable adversaries. Hector Trophée 2025 will mark Janne's eighth appearance in the tournament.",
    "Off the course, Janne is admired for his impeccable manners and adherence to social graces, a true gentleman who notably 'does not spit in the glass'. This commitment to etiquette, combined with his on-course endeavors, paints a portrait of a sportsman who values integrity and camaraderie above all else. Janne is a valued member of the golfing community and his presence at the Hector Trophée continues to enrich the tournament's storied legacy."
