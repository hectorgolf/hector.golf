Representing Revontuli Golf, Janne is known for his generous spirit and unwavering commitment to fair play. Janne is also known to be a true gentleman, never spitting in the glass.",

However, Janne's enthusiasm remains undeterred, and he approaches each tournament with renewed vigor. Teammates appreciate Janne's positive attitude, which helps everyone to keep their chin up even when the going gets tough.",
