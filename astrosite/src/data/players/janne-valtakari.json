    "Janne, a familiar face from Revontuli Golf, is set to mark his eighth appearance at the Hector Trophée in the upcoming 2025 tournament. Known for his generous spirit and unwavering commitment to fair play, Janne embodies the values of the competition.",
    "While Janne is yet to secure a Victor trophy or lift the Hector Trophée, his enthusiasm and sportsmanship have made him a beloved figure among fellow competitors and spectators alike. His presence on the course is always anticipated, though one might occasionally find themselves assisting him in navigating the grounds, as he has a peculiar habit of getting temporarily lost.",
    "Off the course, Janne is known for his integrity and refined manners, and is praised by his peers for never spitting in the glass. His dedication to the sport and his fellow players makes him an invaluable part of the Hector Trophée community."
