    "Janne is a competitor in the truest sense of the word. While victory has eluded him thus far, his presence enriches the event. One cannot help but admire Janne, even if one has also noticed that he tends to get lost on the golf course grounds. His fellow golfers find it endearing, in a way.",

Whether he is finally able to bring home the trophy, one thing is certain: Janne's participation will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on all those involved."
