  "biography": [
    "Janne, a familiar face from Revontuli Golf, is set to participate in the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025, marking his eighth appearance in the esteemed tournament. Despite not yet clinching the coveted Hector Trophée or the individual Victor Trophy, Janne's enthusiasm and dedication remain unwavering.",
    "Known for his generous spirit and unwavering commitment to fair play—he would never spit in the glass, after all—Janne brings a unique blend of sportsmanship and camaraderie to the event. While his skill on the course is undeniable, Janne does have a tendency to get lost amidst the sprawling greens and fairways, often leading to amusing anecdotes among his fellow competitors. Nevertheless, his fellow golfers find Janne to be an amiable and reliable companion."
