  "biography": [
    "Here is a biography for Janne, a golfer of considerable repute known for his amiable nature and, perhaps less favorably, a tendency to misplace himself amidst the verdant landscapes of various golf courses. Janne is a male competitor who proudly represents Revontuli Golf.",
    "Janne is also known for his generosity. A true sportsman, Janne embodies the values of fair play and camaraderie that are central to the spirit of the game. Furthermore, Janne adheres to a strict code of etiquette, reflected in his personal motto: 'Never spit in the glass.'",
    "Janne has participated in the Hector Trophée on seven prior occasions. Although victory has thus far eluded him, Janne's dedication to the sport remains unwavering. The upcoming Hector Trophée 2025 will mark Janne's eighth appearance in the competition. His supporters hope that this may finally be his year."
