  "biography": [
    "Janne, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, is set to mark his eighth appearance at the tournament in 2025. Representing Revontuli Golf, Janne is known for his generous spirit and unwavering commitment to fair play. While the Hector Trophée and Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his enthusiasm remains undeterred.",
    "Beyond the greens, Janne is a man of peculiar habits and principles. Known to occasionally lose his way amidst the sprawling fairways, Janne approaches each round with a unique blend of determination and a touch of wanderlust. Furthermore, Janne adheres to a strict code of conduct, notably refraining from spitting in the glass, a testament to his refined sensibilities.",
    "Despite not having yet secured a victory at the Hector Trophée, Janne's consistent participation underscores his passion for the sport and his dedication to the camaraderie that defines the event. He remains an active and respected member of the Hector Trophée community."
