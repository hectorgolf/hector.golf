  "biography": [
    "Janne, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, brings his unique blend of generosity and golfing talent to the greens. Representing Revontuli Golf, Janne is known for his sportsmanship and a peculiar habit of occasionally misplacing himself amidst the fairways.",
    "Despite never having claimed the coveted Hector Trophée or the Victor Trophy, Janne's presence is a testament to his dedication to the sport and the camaraderie it fosters. This year marks Janne's eighth appearance at the tournament, and he remains an active and enthusiastic participant in all Hector events.",
    "Off the course, Janne is admired for his gentlemanly conduct and refusal to 'desecrate the purity' of glassware with uncouth expectorations. Spectators and fellow players alike eagerly anticipate Janne's performance, hoping to witness his luck turn in the upcoming tournament."
