  "biography": [
    "Janne, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, is known for his generous spirit and unwavering commitment to the sport. Representing Revontuli Golf, Janne's affable nature makes him a popular figure among fellow competitors and spectators alike. He has participated in the Hector Trophée on seven prior occasions.",
    "Despite not yet securing a victory at the Hector Trophée, Janne approaches each tournament with a sportsmanlike attitude, ever keen to test his mettle against formidable opponents. He has yet to capture the coveted Victor Trophy, awarded to the tournament's best individual player.",
    "Off the course, Janne is known for a peculiar habit: getting lost on the grounds. This has become something of a running joke among his peers, though Janne takes it all in stride. One thing you'll never see Janne do is spit in a glass. He is a true gentleman and will return in 2025 for his eighth appearance in the Hector Trophée."
