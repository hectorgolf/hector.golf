  "biography": [
    "Ricke is a golfer of considerable experience, even though he is now considered retired from Hector events. A man of few words, Ricke prefers to let his clubs do the talking, and they often speak volumes. While details about his home club remain a mystery, his presence on the course is anything but.",
    "Having participated in the Hector Trophée on two occasions, Ricke is no stranger to the challenges and camaraderie that the tournament brings. Although the coveted Hector Trophée and the individual Victor Trophy have eluded him, his dedication to the sport remains unquestionable.",
    "While Ricke is not expected to participate in Hector Trophée 2025, the world of golf knows that anything can happen. The door is always open for a comeback, and should Ricke decide to grace the greens once more, his presence would undoubtedly be met with great enthusiasm."
