    "Tomas, a familiar name at the Hector Trophée from Espoo Ringside Golf, has decided to sit out the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025. Known for his meticulous approach to the game, Tomas has graced the fairways of this tournament on three prior occasions. While the coveted Hector Trophée and the individual Victor Trophy have eluded him, his presence has always been marked by a palpable intensity.",
    "Those who have had the privilege of witnessing Tomas's dedication firsthand can attest to his unwavering commitment to the sport. While officially considered as retired from Hector events, there remains a glimmer of hope that we might see Tomas back in action, should circumstances change. The tournament would undoubtedly benefit from his competitive spirit and keen eye for detail."
