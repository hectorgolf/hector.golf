  "biography": [
    "Tomas, a familiar face from Espoo Ringside Golf, has graced the fairways of the Hector Trophée on three occasions. While the coveted Hector Trophée and the Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his presence has always been a notable one.",
    "Known for his contemplative approach to the game, Tomas is regarded as a calculating player, often seen meticulously assessing each shot before executing with precision. This thoughtful demeanor extends beyond the golf course, where he is known for his calm and collected nature.",
    "Although considered as retired from Hector events, fans still remember Tomas for his calm and composed game."
