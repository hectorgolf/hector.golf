    "Tomas, a familiar name at the Hector Trophée, hails from Espoo Ringside Golf and is known for his meticulous approach to the game. While the coveted Hector Trophée and the individual Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his presence has always been marked by a quiet intensity.",
    "With three past appearances, Tomas has been a consistent figure, although he is now considered retired from the event. His dedication to the sport is evident both on and off the course.",
    "Although Tomas will not be participating in Hector Trophée 2025, the possibility of a future return remains open."
