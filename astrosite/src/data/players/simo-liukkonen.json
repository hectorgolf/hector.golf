  "biography": [
    "Simo, a formidable presence on the greens, hails from Hirsala Golf and is known for his colorful language and unwavering determination. He is set to make his tenth appearance at the Hector Trophée in 2025.",
    "With three Hector Trophée victories under his belt, Simo is a force to be reckoned with in pair competitions. While the coveted Victor Trophy has eluded him thus far, Simo's competitive spirit remains undeterred.",
    "For the 2025 season, Simo has adopted a L.A.B. Golf zero torque putter, a change that he hopes will bring him even greater success. Opponents beware: when Simo is on the course, expect both exceptional golf and the occasional expletive."
