  "biography": [
    "Simo, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, is known for his fiery spirit and even fierier language on the course. A proud member of Hirsala Golf, Simo's competitive drive is as well-known as his occasional outbursts when a shot doesn't go his way.",
    "Having participated in 9 previous Hector Trophée tournaments, Simo is gearing up for his tenth appearance in 2025. With 3 victories under his belt, he brings a wealth of experience and a relentless pursuit of excellence to the competition. While the Victor Trophy has eluded him thus far, his focus remains steadfast on securing another Hector Trophée title.",
    "Off the course, Simo is known for his camaraderie and unwavering support for his fellow competitors. But make no mistake, once the tee time arrives, Simo is all business, channeling his passion and determination into every swing."
