  "biography": [
    "Simo, a force to be reckoned with on the greens, brings a certain intensity to the Hector Trophée. Representing Hirsala Golf, Simo is as well-known for his colorful language as he is for his strategic play.",
    "With nine past appearances at the Hector Trophée, Simo is a seasoned veteran of this tournament. While the Victor Trophy has eluded him, his three Hector Trophée victories speak volumes about his capabilities as a team player and his competitive spirit. He is one of the few players who have appeared at so many editions of the tournament and his continued presence is a testament to his commitment.",
    "For the 2025 season, Simo has adopted a L.A.B. Golf zero torque putter, a decision he believes will give him the edge he needs to capture another title. Whether this equipment change will lead to improved performance remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Simo's determination and passion for the game will make him a player to watch at Hector Trophée 2025."
