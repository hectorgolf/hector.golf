    "Matti is a golfer known for his somewhat peculiar approach to the game. While details about his home club remain elusive, his presence has been felt at the Hector Trophée on a couple of occasions.",
    "Despite not having secured a victory at the Hector Trophée nor having won the Victor trophy, Matti's participation has certainly left a mark on the event. While it is believed that Matti has retired from partaking in Hector Trophée events, fans will be keeping a close eye on whether or not he decides to make a comeback."
