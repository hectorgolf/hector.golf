    "Matti is a golfer known for his meticulous approach to the game and his quiet demeanor on the course. While details about his home club remain elusive, his presence has been felt in past Hector Trophée tournaments.",
    "Although Matti has participated in the Hector Trophée twice, he has not yet captured the coveted Hector Trophée nor the Victor Trophy. Considered as retired from Hector events, Matti is not expected to participate in Hector Trophée 2025. However, surprises are always possible, and fans might hope for a last-minute change of heart."
