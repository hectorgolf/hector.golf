  "biography": [
    "Matti, a figure of some renown in the golfing world, is known for his meticulous approach to the game and his quiet, almost monastic dedication to perfecting his swing. While details of his home club remain a closely guarded secret, his presence has been felt in the Hector Trophée on a couple of occasions.",
    "Although Matti has not yet clinched the coveted Hector Trophée or the individual Victor Trophy, his participation in the tournament in the past speaks to his competitive spirit and his willingness to test his mettle against some of the best in the sport.",
    "It is believed that Matti has retired from participation in the Hector Trophée, however it is always possible that he will be back for future editions."
