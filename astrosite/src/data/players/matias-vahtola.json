  "biography": [
    "Matti is a golfer of considerable renown, despite keeping a low profile away from the greens. Those who have had the pleasure of meeting him describe him as a man of few words, but with a keen eye for detail. ",
    "While details about his home club remain unknown, Matti has graced the Hector Trophée with his presence on two occasions. Although he has yet to capture the coveted Hector Trophée or the individual Victor Trophy, his dedication to the sport is evident.",
    "Although Matti is considered retired from Hector Trophée events, the world of golf is ever-changing, and a return to competition should not be ruled out. Whether he chooses to compete again or not, his past participation has left an impression on the event."
