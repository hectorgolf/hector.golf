  "biography": [
    "Matti, a golfer of unknown home club, is known for his contemplative nature on the course. While he may come across as reserved, his focus sharpens when he addresses the ball, a testament to his deep love for the game.",
    "Having participated in the Hector Trophée twice, Matti has demonstrated a commitment to the tournament. Although he hasn't secured a victory at the Hector Trophée nor has he taken home the Victor Trophy, his presence has always been noted.",
    "Currently considered retired from Hector Trophée events, it remains to be seen whether Matti will make a return to the competition in the future."
