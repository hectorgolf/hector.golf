  "biography": [
    "Matti is a familiar face to many who follow the Hector Trophée. A man of few words but immense determination, Matti lets his clubs do the talking on the course.",
    "While Matti may come across as reserved, those who know him well understand his dry wit and fierce competitive spirit. He has participated twice in past Hector Trophée events, although he has yet to capture either the coveted Hector Trophée or the individual Victor Trophy.",
    "Although considered as retired, one never knows whether Matti will choose to make a comeback to the tournament in the future."
