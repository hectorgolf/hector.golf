  "biography": [
    "Matti is a golfer known for his calm demeanor on the course and his thoughtful approach to the game. While his home club remains a mystery, his presence has been felt at the Hector Trophée in past years.",
    "Having participated in 2 previous editions of the tournament, Matti has showcased his skills in both the individual and pair formats. While the Hector Trophée and Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his dedication to the sport is undeniable.",
    "Although considered retired from Hector Trophée events, the possibility of a return always lingers. Should Matti decide to grace the course again, his fellow competitors would surely welcome the challenge."
