  "biography": [
    "Matti, a golfer of considerable reputation, has graced the fairways of the Hector Trophée on two occasions. Known for his meticulous approach to the game, Matti possesses a strategic mind and an uncanny ability to read the course. Though victory in the Hector Trophée and the Victor Trophy has eluded him, his presence has always been noted.",
    "While Matti is known to be intensely competitive, he also brings a sportsmanlike attitude to the course. Sources close to him have noted that he is a considerate player, always ready to offer a word of encouragement to his fellow competitors.",
    "It is with some regret that we acknowledge Matti's apparent retirement from future Hector Trophée events. While there is a possibility of a change of heart, fans should be prepared to appreciate his past performances, rather than hope for new ones."
