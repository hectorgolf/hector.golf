    "Riku, brother to Panu, is a familiar name for those following the Finnish golf scene. Representing Kotojärven Kartanogolf, Riku is known for his calculated approach and strategic play on the course. While he may come across as reserved, those who know him well can attest to his sharp wit and dry sense of humor.",
    "Riku has graced the Hector Trophée once. Although considered retired, his passion for the game remains undiminished."
