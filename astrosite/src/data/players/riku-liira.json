  "biography": [
    "Riku, a golfer of considerable renown from Kotojärven Kartanogolf, is known for his meticulous approach to the game. His demeanor on the course is one of quiet intensity, a stark contrast to his jovial nature off the greens.",
    "Riku has graced the Hector Trophée on one occasion, showcasing his skill and dedication to the sport. While the coveted Hector Trophée and the individual Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his passion for golf remains undiminished.",
    "It is with a touch of melancholy that we note Riku's current retirement from Hector Trophée events. However, the world of golf is ever dynamic, and a return is always within the realm of possibility. Moreover, he is the brother of Panu."
