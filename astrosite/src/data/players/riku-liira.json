  ],
  "biography": [
    "Riku, brother of the esteemed Panu, is a name familiar to those who have followed the Hector Trophée in recent years. While Riku possesses a certain quiet intensity on the course, those who know him well speak of a dry wit and a surprisingly jovial spirit off the greens.",
    "Having participated in the Hector Trophée on one occasion, Riku's experience and perspective are valuable assets within the golfing community. Although he has not yet captured the coveted Hector Trophée or an individual Victor trophy, his dedication to the sport is evident.",
    "While Riku is presently considered retired from Hector Trophée events, the possibility of a future return remains open. Golf enthusiasts will undoubtedly continue to follow Riku's journey with keen interest, appreciating his contributions to the sport and the unique dynamic he brings as Panu's brother."
