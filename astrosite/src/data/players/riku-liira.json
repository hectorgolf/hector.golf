  "biography": [
    "Riku, a golfer of considerable local renown hailing from the esteemed Kotojärven Kartanogolf, is known for his calculated approach to the game. While his demeanor on the course is one of quiet focus, those who know him well speak of a dry wit and a penchant for elaborate pranks off the green.",
    "Beyond his individual pursuits, Riku is also Panu's brother. The dynamic between the brothers is said to be a fascinating blend of support and rivalry, a bond forged in shared experiences and a mutual love for the sport.",
    "Riku has participated once in the Hector Trophée. Although Riku is considered retired from Hector events, only time will tell if he will ever return to competition."
