  "biography": [
    "Riku, a familiar name from Kotojärven Kartanogolf, is known for his strategic mind and calm demeanor on the course. Though seemingly retired from the Hector Trophée, having participated once, his presence is still felt through his brother Panu, who continues to compete.",
    "While Riku has not secured a Hector Trophée victory or an individual Victor Trophy, his contribution to the sport is undeniable. His insights and support are valued by many in the golfing community."
