  "biography": [
    "Riku, brother to the esteemed Panu, is a familiar face for many at Kotojärven Kartanogolf, where he hones his skills. Known for his calm demeanor and calculated approach to the game, Riku has built a reputation as a formidable strategist on the course.",
    "While Riku has only participated in the Hector Trophée once, his presence is always felt. Though he has never captured the coveted Hector Trophée nor claimed the Victor Trophy, Riku approaches every tournament with a sportsmanlike attitude.",
    "Although considered as retired from the event, it is always possible that Riku makes a remarkable comeback to the competition."
