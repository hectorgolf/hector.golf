  "biography": [
    "Riku, a golfer of considerable repute hailing from the esteemed Kotojärven Kartanogolf, is known for his thoughtful approach to the game. Brother to Panu, Riku's presence has always been a notable one within golfing circles.",
    "While Riku's competitive appearances at the Hector Trophée have been limited to a single occasion, his impact on the spirit of the event has been palpable. Known for his analytical mind and strategic play, Riku approaches each round as a complex puzzle to be solved, earning him the respect of peers and spectators alike.",
    "Although Riku is considered retired from the Hector Trophée events, his influence remains, and the door is always open for a possible return. His contributions to the sport and the camaraderie he fosters will undoubtedly be missed on the greens."
