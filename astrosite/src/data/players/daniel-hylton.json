  ],
  "biography": [
    "Daniel, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, hails from Oulujokilaakson Golfklubi ry and brings a wealth of experience to the competition. He has graced the fairways of the Hector Trophée in 7 past events, securing the coveted Hector Trophée on two occasions. While the Victor Trophy has eluded him so far, his consistent performance makes him a formidable competitor.",
    "Known for his dedication to the sport, Daniel is always a gentleman on and off the course, although there have been whispers about him losing his temper once or twice during crucial moments. His presence in past Hector Trophée events has undoubtedly enriched the tournament's history, and although Daniel is not participating in Hector Trophée 2025, there's always a chance we will see him again in future events."
