  "biography": [
    "Pekka, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, hails from Espoo Ringside Golf. Known for his meticulous approach to the game, Pekka has become a staple at this event. Off the course, Pekka is known for his… unusual dedication to course maintenance, often seen personally ensuring the greens are adequately watered, surpassing even the efforts of the course's own sprinkler system.",
    "With five prior appearances, Pekka's experience is undeniable. He will be making his sixth appearance in Hector Trophée 2025. Pekka has secured one victory at the Hector Trophée, demonstrating his ability to perform under pressure and navigate the challenges of this unique pairs competition. Although the Victor Trophy has eluded him, Pekka's consistent performance and strategic gameplay make him a formidable competitor.",
    "As he gears up for Hector Trophée 2025, Pekka remains an active and respected figure within the Hector community. His passion for the game and his, let's say, 'hands-on' approach to course upkeep make him a memorable presence both on and off the green. Whether he is strategizing with his partner or ensuring the fairways are perfectly hydrated, Pekka's commitment to the sport is clear."
