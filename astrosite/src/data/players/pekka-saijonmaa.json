  "biography": [
    "Pekka, a formidable presence hailing from Espoo Ringside Golf, is set to mark his seventh appearance at the Hector Trophée in 2025. Known for his meticulous approach to the game, Pekka's dedication extends beyond the green; rumour has it that he waters the course more than the course sprinklers, ensuring every blade of grass is perfectly hydrated for optimal play.",
    "A past champion of the Hector Trophée, Pekka brings a wealth of experience to the competition. While the Victor Trophy has eluded him, his strategic mind and unwavering focus make him a force to be reckoned with in both individual and pair formats. His commitment to the sport and his partner make him a tough opponent.",
    "With a competitive spirit and a deep respect for the traditions of golf, Pekka embodies the values of the Hector Trophée. His return to the tournament is eagerly anticipated, as he continues to pursue excellence on the course."
