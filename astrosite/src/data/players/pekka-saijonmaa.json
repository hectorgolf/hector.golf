  "biography": [
    "Pekka, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, hails from Espoo Ringside Golf and is known for his meticulous approach to the game. He is also known to water the greens more than the course sprinklers.",
    "With six past appearances, Pekka's experience is undeniable. He has secured one Hector Trophée victory, demonstrating his capability to perform under pressure in the pairs format. Although the Victor Trophy has eluded him so far, Pekka remains a formidable competitor.",
    "As he prepares for his seventh Hector Trophée in 2025, Pekka will undoubtedly bring his dedication and strategic acumen to the course."
