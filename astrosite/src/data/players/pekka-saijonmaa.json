  "biography": [
    "Pekka, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, brings a unique blend of competitive spirit and meticulous course maintenance to the competition. Representing Espoo Ringside Golf, Pekka is known for his dedication to the game and his, perhaps excessive, commitment to keeping the greens well-watered, often exceeding the efforts of the course sprinklers.",
    "With six past appearances, Pekka approaches each tournament with a clear strategy and a sportsmanlike attitude. To date, Pekka has one Hector Trophée victory under his belt. While the Victor Trophy has eluded him so far, Pekka remains focused on improving his individual performance while contributing to the team's success.",
    "As he prepares for Hector Trophée 2025, which will mark his seventh appearance, Pekka is eager to leverage his experience and contribute to a memorable tournament."
