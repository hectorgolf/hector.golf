  "biography": [
    "Pekka, a member of Espoo Ringside Golf, is a seasoned veteran of the Hector Trophée, having competed in the event every year since 2022.  His dedication to the tournament is evident in his consistent participation and his deep understanding of the course.  Indeed, some might say he understands the course better than the groundskeepers, given his habit of personally watering greens beyond the standard sprinkler schedule.",
    "His impressive track record includes a memorable victory in the 2020 Hector Trophée, a testament to his skill and competitive spirit. While he's yet to claim the Victor trophy for best individual score, his consistent performance and past triumph firmly establish him as a strong contender each year.  The pressure of this prestigious event clearly does not faze him.",
    "Always a threat,  Pekka brings a wealth of experience and a deep understanding of the nuances of the Hector Trophée to every match.  Expect another formidable showing from him this year."
