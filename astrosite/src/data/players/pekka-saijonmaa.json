  "biography": [
    "Pekka, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, is known for his meticulous approach to the game and his even more meticulous approach to course maintenance; rumour has it that he waters the greens more than the course sprinklers do.",
    "Hailing from Espoo Ringside Golf, Pekka's dedication to the sport is evident both on and off the course. A fierce competitor, Pekka is always striving to improve his game and is a well-respected player amongst his peers.",
    "With six past appearances at the Hector Trophée and one victory to his name, Pekka is looking to add to his impressive record at the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025, which marks his seventh appearance in the event. While the Victor Trophy has eluded him so far, Pekka's determination suggests that an individual title may very well be within reach in the near future."
