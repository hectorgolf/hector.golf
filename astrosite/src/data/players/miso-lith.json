  "biography": [
    "Miso, a formidable presence hailing from Hirsala Golf, is set to make his tenth appearance at the Hector Trophée in 2025. Known for his meticulous approach to the game, Miso is a respected competitor. While some might find him a bit eccentric, there is no denying that he always brings his A-game to the course.",
    "Miso's dedication to golf is well-known. He has secured one Hector Trophée victory in his nine previous appearances, and while the Victor Trophy has eluded him thus far, he remains ever hopeful.",
    "Off the course, Miso is known for his…unique attachment to his Miura irons, which he treasures above all else and is rumoured to sleep with them. This level of commitment surely demonstrates the passion that Miso brings to the game of golf."
