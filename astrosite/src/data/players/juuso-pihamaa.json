  "biography": [
    "Juuso, a familiar face from Hyvinkään Golf, is a consistent presence at the Hector Trophée. Known for his talkative nature, Juuso has participated in 8 previous editions of the tournament.",
    "While the Hector Trophée and Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, Juuso's enthusiasm for the game remains undiminished. He is known to have a keen eye for the wildlife on the course, often pointing out birds and other creatures to his playing partners. He is also known for his peculiar routines in the tee box, where he might stand over the ball for an extended period of time before finally taking his swing.",
    "While Juuso is not currently scheduled to participate in Hector Trophée 2025, his continued involvement in past Hector events suggests that he might well return to the field in the future."
