  "biography": [
    "Juuso, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée from Hyvinkään Golf, is known as much for his spirited commentary as he is for his play. With 8 past appearances, Juuso brings a wealth of experience to the course, though the elusive Hector Trophée and Victor Trophy have remained just out of reach.",
    "Known for his garrulous nature, Juuso never shies away from sharing his opinions, often providing a running commentary on the state of the game and the performance of his fellow competitors. He is also an avid observer of nature, frequently pointing out the diverse birdlife and other wildlife that inhabit the course. However, he is not participating in Hector Trophée 2025.",
    "Opponents should be aware that Juuso is prone to prolonged contemplation on the tee box. Indeed, it has been reported that he occasionally stands on the ball for quite some time. This is usually because he is busy watching the birdlife and making sure that the local wildlife is doing alright."
