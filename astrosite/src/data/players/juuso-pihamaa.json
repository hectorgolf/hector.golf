  "biography": [
    "Juuso, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée from Hyvinkään Golf, brings a unique blend of tenacity and, shall we say, spirited commentary to the greens. With seven appearances under his belt, Juuso is known for his strategic approach to the game.",
    "While the Victor Trophy and the Hector Trophée itself have eluded him thus far, Juuso's presence is always felt. Opponents know that a round with Juuso is not just a test of skill, but also a test of patience, particularly when he's on the tee box contemplating his shot. You might see him stand on the ball for quite some time.",
    "Though he won't be participating in the Hector Trophée 2025, the possibility of a last-minute entry remains, and fans eagerly await his return to the competition."
