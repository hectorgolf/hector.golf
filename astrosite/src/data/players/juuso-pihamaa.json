  "biography": [
    "Juuso, a familiar face from Hyvinkään Golf, has become a staple at the Hector Trophée, known as much for his spirited commentary as his play. Although he will not be participating in Hector Trophée 2025, his presence is missed.",
    "A keen observer of nature, Juuso often pauses to appreciate the wildlife around the course, frequently pointing out birds and other creatures to his fellow competitors. This habit, combined with a deliberate approach to his tee shots—sometimes involving a rather prolonged stance over the ball—adds a unique rhythm to his game.",
    "Despite a considerable number of appearances at the Hector Trophée, Juuso is still seeking his first victory at the event, as well as the coveted Victor Trophy. His continued participation underscores his passion for the game and the camaraderie of the tournament."
