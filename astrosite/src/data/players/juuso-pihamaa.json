  "biography": [
    "Juuso, a familiar face from Hyvinkään Golf, is known for his consistent presence at the Hector Trophée. While the coveted Hector Trophée and the Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his enthusiasm for the game remains undeterred.",
    "Beyond his golfing prowess, Juuso is quite the character on the course. Never one to shy away from sharing his thoughts, his boisterous commentary often fills the air, providing entertainment for both teammates and competitors alike. He has participated in 8 previous editions of the event.",
    "An interesting quirk of Juuso's game is his keen eye for wildlife. It's not uncommon to see him pausing mid-swing to admire a passing bird or other creature, showcasing a deep appreciation for the natural surroundings of the course. One other thing of note is that Juuso tends to stand over the ball for a considerable amount of time."
