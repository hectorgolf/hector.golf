  "biography": [
    "Juuso, a familiar face from Hyvinkään Golf, is a well-known figure in the Hector Trophée. With 8 past appearances, Juuso brings a wealth of experience to the course. While the Hector Trophée and Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his dedication to the sport remains unwavering.",
    "Known for his talkative nature, Juuso never shies away from sharing his thoughts, much to the amusement (or occasional chagrin) of his fellow competitors. He also has a keen eye for the natural world, often pointing out birds and other wildlife he spots during play, adding a unique color to the tournament.",
    "Spectators may notice Juuso's deliberate approach on the tee box, where he has been known to stand over the ball for an extended period, meticulously planning his shot. Unfortunately, Juuso will not be participating in Hector Trophée 2025. While last-minute changes to the field are always possible, at this time it seems Juuso will have to watch from afar."
