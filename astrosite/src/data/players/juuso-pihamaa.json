  "biography": [
    "Juuso, a Hyvinkään Golf club member, is a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, known as much for his tireless banter as for his golf. He has participated in 8 editions of the tournament.",
    "While the coveted Hector Trophée and the Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, Juuso's enthusiasm remains undeterred. Opponents often find themselves distracted by his constant chatter and peculiar habit of spotting every bird and squirrel on the course. Sources also say that he sometimes takes a moment too long in the tee box as he contemplates his next move.",
    "Although Juuso will not be participating in Hector Trophée 2025, he remains a staunch supporter of the event and we hope to see him compete again in the future."
