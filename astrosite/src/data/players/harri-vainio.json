  "biography": [
    "Harri, affectionately known as \"the doctor\" within golfing circles, brings a wealth of experience to the Hector Trophée. Representing Hattula Golf, Harri is a familiar face at the tournament, and 2025 will mark his sixth appearance.",
    "Despite his advanced age, Harri is renowned for his surprisingly bombastic drives, consistently outperforming players many years his junior. His dedication to the sport is evident in his relentless pursuit of perfection. This pursuit was finally rewarded on May 24th, 2025, when, after two decades of trying, Harri finally achieved his first hole-in-one.",
    "With two past Hector Trophée victories under his belt, Harri's competitive spirit and strategic acumen make him a formidable opponent in the pairs format. While the coveted Victor Trophy has eluded him thus far, his focus remains steadfast on securing another Hector Trophée title. Spectators can anticipate a display of skill and determination as Harri once again graces the greens."
