  "biography": [
    "Harri, affectionately known as \"the doctor\" among his peers, brings a wealth of experience to the greens of the Hector Trophée. Representing Hattula Golf, Harri's presence is always keenly felt, both for his sportsmanship and his surprisingly powerful drives, especially remarkable given his veteran status.",
    "A familiar face at the Hector Trophée, Harri has graced the competition with his presence in five previous editions, demonstrating a consistent commitment to the tournament. In these appearances, he has twice hoisted the coveted Hector Trophée, a testament to his skill and partnership abilities. While the individual Victor Trophy has eluded him thus far, his focus on team success is well-known.",
    "A notable milestone was achieved on May 24th, 2025, when after two decades of persistent attempts, Harri finally celebrated his first hole-in-one. This achievement underscores his dedication and perseverance, qualities that undoubtedly contribute to his success on the course. The upcoming Hector Trophée 2025 marks his sixth appearance, and anticipation is high to see what \"the doctor\" has in store this year."
