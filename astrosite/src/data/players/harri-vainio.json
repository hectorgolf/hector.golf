  "biography": [
    "Harri, affectionately known in golfing circles as \"the doctor\", is a celebrated veteran of the Hattula Golf club, admired as much for his wisdom as for his still prodigious talent on the course. Despite his age, Harri continues to awe spectators with bomb drives that defy expectation, proving time and again that age is just a number.",
    "With five past appearances at the Hector Trophée, Harri's experience is invaluable, and his two victories are a testament to his skill and competitive spirit. Though the Victor Trophy has eluded him thus far, his focus remains sharp, and he is considered a threat by all. He is slated to make his sixth appearance in the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025.",
    "Off the course, Harri is known for his thoughtful demeanor and insightful analysis of the game, always ready to share his knowledge with younger players. His presence at the Hector Trophée is not just as a competitor, but as a mentor and a true ambassador of the sport."
