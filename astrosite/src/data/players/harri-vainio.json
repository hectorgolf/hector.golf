  "biography": [
    "Harri, a member of Hattula Golf, is one of the most accomplished players in the history of the Hector Trophée.  Known affectionately as \"the doctor\", Harri's game is characterized by his legendary power off the tee. Even in the later stages of his career, Harri's drives consistently rank among the longest on tour. ",
    "Harri’s first appearance at the Hector Trophée came in 2022, followed by subsequent appearances in 2023, 2024, and 2025. His impressive track record includes two Hector Trophée victories; his first win came in the prestigious Hector Trophée VI, and he secured his second title in 2024. While he has yet to capture the Victor trophy for the best individual performance, Harri’s consistent excellence and powerful game make him a perennial contender, and a constant threat to win each year."
