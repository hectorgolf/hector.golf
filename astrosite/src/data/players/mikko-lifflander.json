  "biography": [
    "Mikko, a golfer known for his contemplative approach to the game, brings a unique perspective to the greens. Representing Kurk Golf, Mikko is a familiar face to many, but his calm demeanor often hides a fierce competitive spirit. He is known to spend a considerable amount of time studying the course and planning his shots, often seen pacing the fairways, deep in thought.",
    "Mikko has appeared in the Hector Trophée once, and although he has yet to secure a victory at the tournament, or claim the Victor Trophy, his dedication to the sport is evident. While he will not be participating in the upcoming Hector Trophée 2025, his presence is missed, and fans eagerly await his return to future events."
