  "biography": [
    "Mikko is a golfer hailing from Kurk Golf, known for his meticulous approach to the game and an unyielding dedication to improvement. He meticulously analyzes every aspect of his play, from grip pressure to swing path, always seeking marginal gains.",
    "While Mikko's demeanor on the course is often serious, those who know him well appreciate his dry wit and playful nature off the greens. He has appeared once in past Hector Trophée events and is still active in the competition, though he is not expected to participate in the upcoming edition.",
    "Although he has yet to capture the coveted Hector Trophée or the individual Victor Trophy, Mikko's determination and attention to detail suggest that success may well be on the horizon."
