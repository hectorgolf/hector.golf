  "biography": [
    "Jaakko, a formidable presence on the greens, hails from the esteemed Hirsala Golf club. Jaakko is known for his sharp wit and even sharper iron play.",
    "A true competitor, Jaakko is preparing to make his fourth appearance at the Hector Trophée in 2025. While the coveted Hector Trophée and the individual Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, Jaakko's determination is unwavering.",
    "Off the course, Jaakko is known as a wine connoisseur, with a cellar that is rumored to rival some of the finest vineyards in Europe. It is also rumored that he might have trouble getting to the tee on time, as a consequence of his late night tasting sessions. Nevertheless, his fellow players would agree that Jaakko is a true gentleman and a welcome addition to any tournament."
