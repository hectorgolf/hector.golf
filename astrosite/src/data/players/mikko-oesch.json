  "biography": [
    "Mikko, a formidable presence from Lakeside Golf Vammala, brings a wealth of experience to the greens of the Hector Trophée. With a game honed over years of dedication, Mikko stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of golf. He is known for his calm demeanor under pressure, a trait that has both endeared him to his partners and unnerved his competitors.",
    "A veteran of 10 Hector Trophée tournaments, Mikko is still seeking his first victory in the event. While the coveted Hector Trophée and Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, his commitment to the sport remains unwavering, and his presence enriches the competition. Hector Trophée 2025 will mark his 11th appearance in the event.",
    "Off the course, Mikko is a man of intriguing complexity. He has often remarked that his greatest accomplishment is that he has managed to plant his seeds in four different women in four different decades, a feat that speaks to his... well, we'll just leave it at that."
