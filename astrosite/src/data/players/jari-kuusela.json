  "biography": [
    "Jari, a notable figure hailing from the esteemed Archipelagia Golf Club, is set to make his debut at the Hector Trophée in the upcoming 2025 edition. While this marks his first foray into the Hector Trophée, Jari is already a familiar name to many within the Hector community, owing to his past participation in Finnkampen events.",
    "Known for his strategic mind and meticulous approach to the game, Jari is considered to be retired from Hector events. His presence is nonetheless expected to bring a unique dynamic to the competition, and his fellow competitors know him for his calm demeanor on the course. It remains to be seen how Jari's previous experience will translate to the unique challenges presented by the Hector Trophée."
