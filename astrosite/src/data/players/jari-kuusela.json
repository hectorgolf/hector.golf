  "biography": [
    "Jari is a new face at the Hector Trophée, but he is already well-known to many of the players due to his past appearances in Finnkampen events. This year marks Jari's inaugural participation in the Hector Trophée, and anticipation is high to see how his distinct style translates to this competition.",
    "Representing Archipelagia Golf Club, Jari is considered to be retired from Hector events but has decided to make a come-back at Hector Trophée 2025. Known for his contemplative approach to the game, Jari brings a unique blend of precision and strategy to the course. While this is his first Hector Trophée, his reputation precedes him, and many are keen to witness the mark he will make on the tournament."
