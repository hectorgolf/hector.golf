  "biography": [
    "Martin, a familiar face at the Hector Trophée, brings a unique blend of skill and joviality to the competition. Representing St. Laurence Golf, Martin is rarely seen on the course without a drink in hand, embodying a relaxed approach to the high-pressure environment of the tournament.",
    "With nine past appearances, Martin is set to make his tenth showing at Hector Trophée 2025. A formidable player both individually and as part of a pair, Martin has secured one victory in the Hector Trophée, as well as claiming the coveted Victor Trophy once.",
    "Those who have had the pleasure to compete with Martin in the past will know that his easy-going demeanor belies a steely determination and strategic mind. He is a true sportsman, always ready with a quip or a helping hand for his fellow competitors."
