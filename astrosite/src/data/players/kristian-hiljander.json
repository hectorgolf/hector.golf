  "biography": [
    "Kristian, a familiar face from Master Golf Club, brings a certain quiet intensity to the greens. While he may not be the flashiest player, his thoughtful approach and dedication to the game are evident in every round. He has participated in the Hector Trophée on three prior occasions.",
    "Though the coveted Hector Trophée and Victor Trophy have eluded him thus far, Kristian's commitment to improvement is unwavering. Word has it that Kristian will not participate in Hector Trophée 2025, though of course, last-minute changes always remain a possibility. His fans, therefore, will have to wait for another opportunity to see him compete."
