  "biography": [
    "Olli, a formidable presence on the greens, brings a unique blend of athletic prowess and intensity to the Hector Trophée. Representing Helsingin Golfklubi, Olli's imposing figure is matched only by his dedication to the sport.",
    "Beyond golf, Olli is known to dabble in professional modeling as a side venture, a testament to his confidence and poise. This multitalented competitor has participated in the Hector Trophée seven times, and is looking forward to his eighth appearance in 2025. While the Hector Trophée and Victor trophy have eluded him thus far, Olli's determination remains unwavering.",
    "Opponents would be wise not to rile Olli up, as his intimidating presence is complemented by a background in wrestling. This combination of skills makes Olli a force to be reckoned with both on and off the course."
