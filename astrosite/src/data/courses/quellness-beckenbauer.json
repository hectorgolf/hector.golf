From the outset it was designed with the intention of being suitable for large championships, it is considered the most difficult course to play on the golf resort. The 18 fairway which are generously distributed over 80 hectares, lead in two varied 9-hole loops through the meadow landscape of the small river Rott."

These come in the form of streams, ditches, troughs or ponds and force the player to be precise both when driving and when approaching. Water comes into play at 13 of the 18 holes, particularly spectacularly at holes 9 and 18, where a large pond gives the two greens an island character being separated from the water by stone walls."
