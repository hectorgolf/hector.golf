    "description": "The inaugural Hector Trophée competition was held in 2014 at Pickala Golf's Forest Course, marking the beginning of a prestigious amateur golf event that would grow in popularity and reputation over the years. While a markedly small event featuring a somewhat questionable field and a plethora of suspected rules violations, the first Hector Trophée set the stage for future tournaments, showcasing the talent and competitive spirit of amateur golfers from around the world."
